# New Outreach Member Training
All things a new Outreach member need to know to get on the right track of becoming a better contributor

## Outreach Overview 
Welcome to HiCoding Club! My name is Andrew and I am in charge of managing the Outreach part of the club. Before you guys officially contribute as a Outreach member, you will complete a training session in order to familiarize yourself with GitHub and setting up the environment on your computer. 


## Outreach Training 
All training materials will be assigned and posted to you under the "Issue" tab. Upon completion, simply close the issue for review. 

## Questions or Concerns? 
If there are any questions or concerns, feel free to email me. My email is andrew.paul@warriorlife.net
